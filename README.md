[![Run tests](https://github.com/wearefuturegov/outpost/workflows/Run%20tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wearefuturegov/outpost/actions)

A [standards-driven](https://opencommunity.org.uk/) API and comprehensive set of admin tools for managing records about local community services, groups and activities.

Outpost is part of [The Outpost Platform](https://outpost-platform.wearefuturegov.com/) a suite of applications, tools and resources that make new kinds of service directories possible. Its free, open source and community driven.

Outpost is designed to be combined with the [Outpost API](https://github.com/wearefuturegov/outpost-api-service/) which provides public data to other tools in the Outpost Platform ecosystem. There is also an example front-end for Outpost, [Scout](https://github.com/wearefuturegov/scout-x).

## üß± How it's built

Outpost is a a Rails app backed by a PostgreSQL database.

It can also act as an OAuth provider via [Doorkeeper](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper).

It uses Google APIs for geocoding and map features, and Gov Notify to send emails.

### Building a public index

Outpost's API component relies on a public index stored on MongoDB.

You can run `rails build_public_index` to build the public index for the first time. Active record callbacks keep it up to date as services are changed.

### Enable multiple directories feature

To see multiple directories in Outpost, run the app with:

```
INSTANCE=buckinghamshire rails s
```

This will start the app with the directories listed in `config/app_config.yaml`.

To add more directories, or set up another instance with separate directories,
edit `config/app_config.yaml`.

## üíª Running it locally

For more information see [getting setup](https://outpost-platform.wearefuturegov.com/docs/outpost/developers/getting-setup)

With [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and [docker](https://www.docker.com/), after cloning the project:

- Bring up the databases with `docker-compose up`
- Populate your environment variables
- Run the application with `rails s`

## üåé Running it on the web

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

It's suitable for 12-factor app hosting like [Heroku](http://heroku.com). It has a `Procfile` that will [automatically run](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/release-phase) pending rails migrations on every deploy, to reduce downtime.

## üß™ Tests

It has some rspec tests on key functionality. Run them with:

```
bundle exec rspec
```

## Code coverage

SimpleCov and Codecov are set up to track code coverage. To see the code
coverage on a local branch, run the test suite and open `coverage/index.html`:

```
rake
open coverage/index.html
```

The coverage report is sent to Codecov after the tests run in CI. Once you open
a PR, Codecov will post a comment with a handy coverage delta and a link to view
line-by-line coverage for the PR.

## üîê OAuth provider

Outpost can work as an identity provider for other apps. Users with the highest permissions can access the `/oauth/applications` route to create credentials.

Once authenticated, consumer apps can fetch information about the currently logged in user with the `/api/v1/me` endpoint.

## üß¨ Configuration

You can provide config with a `.env` file. Run `cp .env.example .env` to create a fresh one.

It needs the following extra environment variables to be set:

## üå• Google Cloud Active Storage

Setting up google cloud active storage.

When working locally, you can drop your `keyfile.json` into `config/secrets/gcp.json`

To deploy your credentials use

```sh
heroku config:set GCP_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="$(< config/secrets/gcp.json)" -a heroku-app-name
```

## üóì Administrative tasks

Outpost depends on on several important [`rake`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v3.2/command_line.html) tasks.

Some of these can be run manually, and some are best scheduled using [Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler) or similar.
