# üíø Data Import

There are two files included in this repository, [data-import--with-sample-data.csv](./data-import--with-sample-data.csv) and [data-import.csv](./data-import.csv). These files will allow you to run an initial import of your data to Outpost. 

* Each row in the document must have a unique numeric ID `import_id`. If this ID is missing the import script will not run.
* `name` - If there are duplicate service names - the script will output an error
* `organisation` - If no organisation exists by this name we will create it
* `organisation` - If this field is blank then we will create an Unnamed organisation for this service
* `visible` - If `visible_from` and `visible_to` are set then this field will be set to `FALSE`


**Multiple Rows**   
Some services can have multiple pieces of data assigned to them. `locations`, `cost`, `schedule`, `links` and `contacts`
In order to add multiple locations to a service you would create one entry for your service with the first location in that row. In order to add the second location you would create a new row, with the `import_id_reference` equal to the service row you created. You then fill in the columns with the additional data. 


## üè† Data structure

## Hints and Tips

If you are using google sheets you can dynamically create lists to track data you have inputted into certain fields. This will help you track down any typos and refine your data further.

This is useful for Organisations, Taxonomies, Suitabilities, Accessibilities, Labels and SEND needs. 

This formula will take all data from the 2nd row to infinity and create a unique list based off all the comma delimited lists you have entered.


```
=ArrayFormula(transpose(trim(split(TEXTJOIN(",",true,'Service Data'!O2:O),","))))
```
