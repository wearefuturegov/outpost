# üíø Custom fields

There are two files included in this repository, [custom-fields-template--with-sample-data.csv](./custom-fields-template--with-sample-data.csv) and [custom-fields-template.csv](./custom-fields-template.csv). These files will allow you to run an initial import of your data to Outpost. 

* Each row in the document must have a unique numeric ID `import_id`. If this ID is missing the import script will not run.
* The `import_id_reference` field refers to the section that custom field belongs to.
* Each field requires a section.
* `name` - If there are duplicate custom field section names - the script will **continue** and assign all fields to the existing section
* `name` - If there are duplicate custom field names, even under other sections - the script will output an error but continue with import
